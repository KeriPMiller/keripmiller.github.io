    <h3>From Art to Tech</h3>
    <p className={styles.story}>
      I'm a New York City developer with a passion for tech and art. I love making creative and fun projects that either make my life easier or happier.
    </p>
    <p className={styles.story}>
      I feel in love with coding after a surprise guest speaker gave a lecturer at a meetup about creating art with Processing. I absolutely loved it. I've always had thought of programming as just this utilitarian tool, I never had thought about it as a form of art itself. I started self teaching and going to other meetups. In 2017, I graduated Fullstack Academy's Grace Hopper Program and here I am today!
